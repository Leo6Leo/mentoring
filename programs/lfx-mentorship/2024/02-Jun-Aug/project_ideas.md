### Knative

#### Improve Knative Eventing Onboarding

- Description:
Onboarding new end users into a sophisticated system like Knative Eventing presents significant challenges, especially as it involves understanding not only the operational components but also a distinct architectural style - event driven architecture (EDA). These issues are also seen in the current documentation which is often too technical and not geared towards practical guidance.  This project seeks to perform a thorough investigation into the barriers that prevent smooth user onboarding and sustained engagement. By identifying these obstacles and developing clearer, more actionable onboarding materials, we aim to enhance the ease of entry and ongoing use of Knative Eventing for all users.

- Expected Outcome:
1. Produce a detailed report based on user research that outlines the current onboarding experience for new users of Knative Eventing. This report will highlight key barriers and challenges in the documentation and setup process, and recommend actionable improvements to make the onboarding process more user-friendly and less technically daunting.

2. Implement the proposed changes within the Knative community by developing comprehensive onboarding materials and enhancing existing documentation to better support new users.

- Recommended Skills: User Research, Communication, Technical Writing, Content Design
